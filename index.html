    <br>
    <br>
    Dr Smith offers a technique:
    <br>
 Find a Comfortable Position: Start by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position.
 <br>
 Close your eyes if it helps you relax.
 <br>
Focus on Your Breath: Take a few deep breaths to settle into the practice. 
<br>
Pay attention to the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body.
<br>
Visualize a Square: Imagine a square in front of you.
<br>
 As you inhale, trace one side of the square in your mind. As you exhale, trace the next side of the square.
 <br>
Controlled Breathing: Breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose for a count of four as you trace one side of the square.
<br>
 Hold your breath for a count of four as you trace the next side. 
 <br>
 Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for a count of four as you trace the third side. 
 <br>
 Hold your breath again for a count of four as you complete the square.
 <br>
Repeat: Continue this pattern of breathing, focusing on the square visualization and maintaining a steady rhythm. 
<br>
Aim to make each breath smooth and even, without straining.
<br>
Practice Regularly: Square breathing is most effective when practiced regularly, especially during times of stress or anxiety.
<br>
 You can use this technique anytime and anywhere you feel the need to calm your mind and body.
